            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            I'm a Computer Science and Math student at the University of
            Houston. I'm passionate about learning, picking up new technologies,
            and solving complex problems. I also enjoy helping others grow and
            succeed alongside me. Throughout my undergrad, I've gained
            experience across the stack, from frontend and backend development
            to machine learning and automation tools. Currently I am focusing on
            Web Development, Automation Tools, and Machine Learning.

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Outside of tech, I'm a big fan of the Houston Astros and Texans. I
            love discovering new music, exploring the city, and playing video
            games. I'm always looking for fresh experiences and inspiration
            beyond the screen. Feel free to check out my projects, browse my
            experience, or connect with me on LinkedIn or via email.
